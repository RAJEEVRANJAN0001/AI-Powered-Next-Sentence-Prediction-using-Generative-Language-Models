# AI-Powered-Next-Sentence-Prediction-using-Generative-Language-Models
this project is to develop a Next Sentence Prediction system using multiple Generative AI models. The application takes an input sentence from the user and generates several coherent and context-aware next sentence predictions using state-of-the-art NLP models such as Google Gemini, GPT-2, and BERT.
